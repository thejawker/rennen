# rennen üèÉ

rennen (Dutch for running) runs a number of commands simultaneously and is built with the [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework. it's designed to be simple, clean, and easy to use.

## installation

you can install rennen by downloading the binary from the download section.

## usage

once you've downloaded the binary, you can run rennen with the following command:

```bash
./rennen
```

## configuration

rennen requires a configuration file named `ren.json` in the same directory where the binary is run. this file should contain a `processes` array where each object represents a process that rennen should manage. each process object should have a `shortname`, `command`, and `description`.

here's an example of what the `ren.json` file could look like:

```json
{
  "processes": [
    {
      "shortname": "frontend",
      "command": "yarn start",
      "description": "starts the frontend server"
    },
    {
      "shortname": "server",
      "command": "php artisan serve",
      "description": "starts the laravel server"
    }
    //... add more processes as needed
  ]
}
```

## development setup

if you want to contribute to rennen or run it in a development environment, you'll need to set up your environment first. here's how you can do it:

1. clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thejawker/rennen.git
```

2. navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rennen
```

3. install the dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

4. build the project:

```bash
make build
```

5. run the project:

```bash
make run
```

6. check the logs
since the only thing visible is the output of the commands, you can open a new terminal and run the following command:
```bash
make logs
```
