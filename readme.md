# run ren rennen üèÉüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

ren (Dutch for run) runs a predefined set of commands simultaneously and has the option to trigger individual commands. it's designed to relief you from having to remember a zillion commands to type in before you can get to work.

## installation

there's only mac support for the moment, linux and windows _m i g h t_ come in the future. kinda depends you know...

### mac
```bash
brew install thejawker/tappen/rennen
```

## usage

once you've downloaded the binary, you can run `ren` with the following command:

```bash
ren init # to create a ren.json file
ren # to start it
```

## configuration
`ren` requires a configuration file named `ren.json` in the same directory where the binary is run. this file should contain a `processes` array where each object represents a process that rennen should manage. each process object should have a `shortname`, `command`, and `description`.

here's an example of what the `ren.json` file could look like:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "shortname": "open mailhog",
      "command": "open http://localhost:8025/",
      "description": "opens the mailhog page"
    }
  ],
  "processes": [
    {
      "shortname": "frontend",
      "command": "yarn start",
      "description": "starts the frontend server"
    },
    {
      "shortname": "server",
      "command": "php artisan serve",
      "description": "starts the laravel server"
    }
  ]
}
```

## development setup

if you want to contribute to rennen or run it in a development environment, you'll need to set up your environment first. here's how you can do it:

1. clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thejawker/rennen.git
```

2. navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd rennen
```

3. install the dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

4. build the project:

```bash
make build
```

5. run the project:

```bash
make run
```

6. check the logs
since the only thing visible is the output of the commands, you can open a new terminal and run the following command:
```bash
make logs
```

## roadmap
read these things that i should do but probably won't [here](todo.md)
